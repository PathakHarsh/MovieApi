# MovieApi
Rest Framework api with web scraping

DONT RUN THE get_data.py file.That file is used to scrape movie details from the imdb website.The movie data is already added in the dbsqlite file.If you want to execute the file delete all movies in the database.BUT THE SCRAPING WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO FINISH.

I have added two screenshots as example for the url.
